# Prog 2:Trinity

Create an interface so two players can take turns choosing from among 9 playing pieces ( (A,B,C,)   (1,2,3)   (a,b,c) ) to try and get 3 pieces of a particular kind in a row in a 3x3 board. Play alternates between the two players.  Pieces can only be used once, and cannot be moved once played. Three in a row of a particular kind can be achieved by any of the following three possibilities:

1) Three of the same set, namely all three upper-case, all three lower-case, or all three numbers, in any order.  
Examples are:  A B C,  1 3 2,    c b a
2) Three of the same set position (first, second or third).  In other words A is in the first position of the (A,B,C) set, and 2 is in the second position of the (1,2,3) set.  
Examples are:  A 1 a,    2 b B,    3 C c

3) One of each set position (first, second or third).  One value must be from the first position of one of the sets, a second value must be from the second position of one of the other sets, and the third value must be from the third position of the remaining set.  
Examples are:  A 2 c,    B 1 c,    a, 3, B
